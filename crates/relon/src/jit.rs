//! Dart-style canonical JIT entry — [`JitEvaluator`].
//!
//! Pairs with [`relon_codegen_native::AotEvaluator`] to expose a
//! two-mode user-facing surface (JIT vs AOT) over the three internal
//! tiers Relon already ships:
//!
//! * **`JitTier::TreeWalk`** — initial interpretation + fallback for
//!   the four non-`run_main` `Evaluator` methods. Always present
//!   because every other tier (bytecode VM, trace JIT) can only
//!   answer `run_main`, and `eval` / `eval_root` / `force_thunk` /
//!   `invoke_closure` need an AST-aware backend.
//! * **`JitTier::Bytecode`** — the M2-A scalar-envelope stack VM
//!   (`relon_bytecode::BytecodeEvaluator`). Populated lazily on the
//!   first `run_main` if `BytecodeEvaluator::from_source` accepts the
//!   shape; rejected sources transparently fall through to the
//!   tree-walker so the dispatcher never panics on out-of-envelope
//!   workloads.
//! * **`JitTier::Trace`** — the cranelift-emitted hot-trace JIT.
//!   Activated automatically once the bytecode tier's per-`fn_id`
//!   hot-counter saturates: the wrapper wires
//!   [`relon_codegen_native::CraneliftHotTrigger`] (recorder kick-off)
//!   and [`relon_codegen_native::CraneliftTraceLookup`] (dispatcher
//!   switch) onto the bytecode evaluator at construction time so the
//!   first `run_main` past the threshold (the bytecode VM's default
//!   [`relon_bytecode::DEFAULT_HOT_THRESHOLD`] = 1000, picked to keep
//!   warm-up cycles bounded for the cold caller while leaving any
//!   real hot loop ample headroom to trip) records, the recorder
//!   lowers + the cranelift backend emits, and subsequent
//!   invocations route through the installed trace via the
//!   dispatcher-switch bypass.
//!
//! ## Tier escalation lifecycle
//!
//! 1. `JitEvaluator::new` allocates a unique `fn_id` from the JIT
//!    wrapper's slot range and stamps it on the bytecode evaluator's
//!    compiled function. It also re-runs the parse + analyze + IR
//!    lowering pipeline to recover the IR op stream and parameter
//!    types, then calls
//!    [`relon_codegen_native::register_recording`] so the recorder
//!    has a body to walk when the trigger fires.
//! 2. The bytecode evaluator runs normally for the first
//!    [`relon_bytecode::DEFAULT_HOT_THRESHOLD`] invocations
//!    (`active_tier` reports `Bytecode`).
//! 3. On the threshold-crossing invocation the bytecode dispatch
//!    prologue trips the `CraneliftHotTrigger`, which drives the
//!    recorder + optimiser + emitter pipeline; the resulting
//!    [`relon_codegen_native::JITedTraceFn`] is installed in the
//!    process-global [`relon_codegen_native::TraceJitState`].
//! 4. Subsequent invocations consult the dispatcher switch via the
//!    `CraneliftTraceLookup` adapter on the same evaluator; a hit
//!    bypasses the bytecode dispatch loop entirely and returns the
//!    trace fn's `result_slot` (`active_tier` flips to `Trace`).
//!    Guard failure routes through the bytecode VM's partial-resume
//!    path; the trace stays installed so steady-state workloads keep
//!    the bypass.
//! 5. On drop, the wrapper releases the `fn_id` (clears the recorder
//!    registration + invalidates the installed trace) so a re-built
//!    evaluator over the same source doesn't observe stale state.
//!
//! Mirrors the canonical tier-escalation shape from LuaJIT /
//! Dart VM (interpreter → bytecode → tracing JIT) and lines up with
//! the `naming-refactor-completion.md` Open Followups §1 mandate:
//! "make `JitEvaluator::run_main` auto-escalate via the hot-counter
//! threshold so the `relon_jit` bench row catches up to the
//! `relon_trace_jit` row on hot-loop workloads."
//!
//! Hosts that want the auto-tier flavour pair this wrapper with
//! [`crate::Backend::Auto`] / [`crate::AutoEvaluator`], which already
//! routes `run_main` through cranelift-AOT lazily. The two surfaces
//! coexist: AOT is a "compile once up-front" path; JIT is a "warm up
//! through tiers as the workload turns out to be hot."
