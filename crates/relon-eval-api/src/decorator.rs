//! Hosts extend Relon's `@name(...)` syntax by implementing

//! host-side plugin live in their respective backend / host crates.

///
/// * [`pre_eval`](Self::pre_eval) runs before the decorated node is evaluated.
///   Use it to inject locals into scope (`#import`) or take over the value
///   entirely (`#schema`).
/// * [`wrap`](Self::wrap) runs after the node is evaluated. Use it to validate
///   or transform the value (`@ensure.int`, `@currency("USD")`).
/// * [`schema_field_meta`](Self::schema_field_meta) runs while extracting
///   fields from a `#schema`-annotated dict. Use it to attach per-field
///   metadata such as defaults or custom error messages (`#expect`, `#default`).
///
/// All hooks default to no-op / identity, so plugins only override what they
/// actually need.
